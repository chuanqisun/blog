## Intro

Why scraping
- Publisher website may be poorly designed to meet user's needs
- Automate Ttedious actions can save us time
- Get structured data for downstream work

Define ethical scraping:
- Scraping is a series of shortcut we take using the browser.
- Do NOT violate publisher policies. 
- Example of unethical scraping:
  - Using stolen credentials
  - Using bot network or P2P technology to share  
  - Redistribute, sell scraped content

## Gathering information from publisher website

Use case:
- Get paper title, author, and abstract
- Gathers URLs to download the paper (with other tools)

Techniques:
- manual console scripting
- Use LLM dom analysis to generate script

Example human written script
```js
...
const data = document.querySelectorAll...
...
const downloadLink = ...
downloadLink.click();
```

Prompt template
```txt
Based on the current document HTML, write a javascript snippet I can copy and paste in the browser console to run.

Requirments:
- Gather content in json array, each item should include: paperTitle, author, downloadUrl, abstract
- Auto download the result.json by creating <a> tag and click it for the user

Document HTML:
{{ pasted_document_html }} 
```

## Bulk download

Use case:
- Download a large collection of papers
- Avoid violation of rate limits

Techniques:
- Server scripting
- Browser automation framework run


Server scripting example (with RxJS)
```js
(show example using mergeMap with concurrency = 3) to avoid rate limit
(show another example using throttle) for time based limit
```

## Browser Automation framework 

Use case:
- Perform human + machine hybrid actions.
  - Human to perform authentication, then handoff to machine to browsing and downloading

Techniques:
- Use Playwright "test" as a scraping tool
- Use online browser as a service for LLMs

## PDF to Markdown

Use case:
- Convert paper for AI to analyze

Techniques:
- One off conversions in chat environment
- Programmatic conversion with completion API and PDF as attachments

Example prompt
```txt
Show an example of how to ask AI to convert paper to markdown
```

Example of pdf to markdown conversion with LLM
```ts
Show an example of OpenAI's latest response API with user attached content
```
