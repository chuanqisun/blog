I thought LinkedIn was all about professional network. But now it's full of self-help and self-promotional crap.

I don't need your coaching. My mentor is the public library.  
I don't care if you drive a Ferrari or a Porsche. Luxury lifestyle doesn't speak to me.

Thanks for sharing your transformation story. But count me out if you want to monetize it. The selfish boasts WHAT they have built. The generous shares HOW you can build it too.

If everyone makes a living by influencing others, who is left to do the actual work? I'm more inspired by people who get their shit done without bragging a word. Because influence is the result of work. Not the other way around.
