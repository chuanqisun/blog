I'm a designer who codes and a developer who designs. I've noticed that I'm more relaxed at coding tasks than design ones. So I came up with a framework to understand the difference between the different types of work and how they affect my mental state.

## Type 1 Work

Type 1 work involves tasks that, while requiring significant effort, come with a clear path to completion. These tasks are characterized by known unknowns, where the challenges are identifiable and the steps to overcome them are laid out. This type of work allows individuals to enter a flow state, where they can focus intensely and perform at their best, knowing that their efforts will yield predictable returns. The low-risk nature of Type 1 work makes it a staple in performance-driven environments, where achieving set goals is paramount.

## Type 2 Work

In contrast, Type 2 work is defined by its creative demands and the presence of unknown unknowns. This type of work is not necessarily time-consuming, but it is high-risk, with no guaranteed path to success. The unpredictable nature of Type 2 tasks can lead to feelings of uncertainty and imposter syndrome, as individuals grapple with the possibility of investing effort without tangible results. However, engaging in Type 2 work is often a sign of being in a learning mode, where exploration and innovation take precedence over immediate performance.

## Comparison

For me, coding is often Type 1 work, while design is Type 2 work. I've made this chart to compare the two types of work. Knowning which type of work I'm currently doing helps me approach challanges with the right mindset.

| Aspect             | Type 1 Work         | Type 2 Work                |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Effort             | Significant         | Variable                   |
| Risk Level         | Low                 | High                       |
| Path to Completion | Clear               | Unclear                    |
| Challenges         | Known unknowns      | Unknown unknowns           |
| Mental state       | Flow                | Stress                     |
| Outcome            | Predictable returns | Exploration and innovation |
