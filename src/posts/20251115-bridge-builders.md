I still remember the first time I watched someone else finish my journey for me.

In the final scene of _Journey_, you trudge through snow toward the mountaintop, cape stiff, movement heavy. When I played it, I thought I was alone. Then a second traveler emerged from the white noise, their chime answering mine. We huddled together until the wind swallowed us.

If you want to see the moment two cloaked figures lean on each other as they cross the snow, followed by the quiet reveal of the strangers' IDs in the credits:

Only after the credits did the game reveal the IDs of the strangers who had walked with me. Until that moment, they were not usernames. They were simply: someone who waited when I fell behind.

I cried, a little. Not because of the ending, but because a videogame had given me a glimpse of the world I wish we lived in.

Journey really is a Japanese garden: no chat, no kill feed, no leaderboard. Just sand, wind, music, and one other person.

After COVID, the world feels darker to me. We are more connected than ever, yet the default interaction in games and increasingly in politics is to aim, shoot, and move on. I scroll through store pages full of military skins, tactical reload animations, and battle passes. The industry has optimized fun around domination and spectacle.

Meanwhile, the games that moved me most in the last decade did something much quieter: they asked me to [_carry_](https://communityofwriters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Carrier-Bag-Theory-of-Fiction.pdf), not to kill.

## The Weight of Care

On the surface, _Death Stranding_ is a delivery simulator. You are Sam Porter Bridges, a courier trudging between isolated cities in a ruined America, carrying packages for clients who rarely step outside. You stack boxes higher than your head, strap more onto your legs and back, and wobble across rivers and up cliffs.

One early sequence gives you the shape of the whole game in miniature: Sam carrying his mother's body across a canyon toward a crematorium, the camera lingering on the weight of the corpse, the straps digging into his shoulders, a lyric soundtrack swelling underneath:

From the outside, the premise looks almost parodically slow. Yet watching people stream their playthroughs, I kept noticing the same thing: they started with jokes about "walking simulators" and ended up talking about love, loneliness, and the weight of care.

Most online games treat other players as either opponents or background noise. _Death Stranding_ quietly inverts this. You rarely see another player in real time, but you inhabit a shared landscape. Every ladder someone places, every bridge they build, every rope they leave dangling from a cliff can appear in your world.

You see usernames attached to structures that saved you from sliding down a slope or drowning in a river. You add your own pieces, knowing that somewhere, in someone else's instance of this world, your effort might turn a frustrating climb into a small relief.

The design reframes what "progress" means. The optimal strategy isn't just to maximize your own deliveries. It's to build infrastructure that outlives your current session.

We usually talk about bridges as metaphors for connection. _Death Stranding_ literalizes that metaphor and lets players inhabit it, step by step, with aching knees.

## Architecture as a Time Bridge

Construction on Gaudí's basilica in Barcelona started in 1882 and continues today. Generations of architects, artisans, and construction workers have dedicated their lives to a building they will never see finished. The Sagrada Família is not just architecture; it's a bridge stretched across more than a century of time.

Even at a distance, the project makes two scales visible at once: the human scale of individual labor and the geologic scale of cultural projects that exceed a single lifetime. Every stone set by a mason becomes scaffolding for future work. Every design decision constrains or enables the artists decades later.

The Sagrada Família operates on the same logic as _Death Stranding's_ shared world. You inherit unfinished work. You add something that will mainly benefit people you will never meet.

Bridges, whether steel or stone or digital, are promises extended into the future.

## Singing for Others

If _Death Stranding_ is about carrying the weight of others, _Journey_ is about lightening it.

In most online games, the design vocabulary for interaction is narrow: aim, shoot, emote, trash talk. Journey removes almost all of that and leaves you with a chime. A single button that emits a musical note and a brief glow.

The music of Journey is diegetic. Your chime charges your companion's scarf, letting them fly higher. Their chime recharges yours. The soundtrack swells not as a backdrop, but as a direct consequence of your combined play. You are not talking _about_ cooperation; you are literally breathing life into each other through sound.

It's hard to overstate how radical this is in a medium dominated by power fantasies. Journey's most important design decision is what it _refuses_ to let you do. You cannot grief. You cannot teabag. You cannot yell slurs into voice chat. The only power you have over another person is the power to wait for them.

Games reflect the values we uphold. When we reward headshots and optimize time to kill, we're not making "neutral" design choices. We're encoding a theory of what counts as skill, what deserves applause. After COVID, as misinformation and anger metastasized through social media, I found myself less able to shrug off hours of simulated violence as "just fun".

I don't think all shooting games are bad. I grew up on them. But I do feel a quiet longing: what if the mainstream of games shifted, even slightly, from perfecting the art of killing to perfecting the art of caring?

## Asynchronous Empathy

Both _Death Stranding_ and _Journey_ rely on a particular design trick: asynchronous cooperation.

In _Death Stranding_, you lay a ladder now so that someone else, days later, won't slip into the ravine. In _Journey_, you might be guiding a newcomer up a dune while a veteran once did the same for you. The emotional payoff arrives with a delay. You don't get an immediate dopamine hit for pressing the button. The game asks you to trust that your kindness will matter.

This feels closer to real life than the zero sum loops of traditional multiplayer. Most of the meaningful bridges we build are like this. You donate to an open source project whose maintainer you'll never meet. You write documentation for a future teammate you haven't hired yet. You teach your child to be gentle, hoping they'll carry that gentleness into a world you'll no longer inhabit.

The Sagrada Família will not send its builders a push notification of thanks. Its gratitude is encoded in the awe of tourists a hundred years from now.

## Bridge Builders

When I think about the future of games, I don't dream of higher resolutions or larger maps. I think about small, stubborn design choices that prioritize bridges over walls.

The goosebumps I felt at the end of Journey, or watching Sam carry his mother's body up a mountain to cremation in _Death Stranding_ streams, didn't come from spectacle. They came from something quieter: grief, responsibility, the choice to show up for each other when it's hard, slow, and boring.

Once you've felt what it's like to build a bridge that helps a stranger, it's hard to pretend all we want from this medium is better guns.

I don't think violence in fiction is inherently immoral, but we are leaving so much on the table. Games are uniquely capable of simulating systems of care, of making you _feel_ the drag of an overloaded backpack or the relief of a companion's chime in a snowstorm. They can show us how to build more bridges and sing for each other.

Somewhere out there, as you read this, someone is booting up _Journey_ for the first time. Another player is silently joining their session, ready to walk beside them with no promise of reward. In another instance of _Death Stranding_, a ladder you placed months ago might still be helping couriers cross a canyon.

None of you will ever meet. But the bridges are real.
