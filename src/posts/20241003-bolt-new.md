[Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) is a [Vercel v0](https://v0.dev/chat) competitor by StackBlitz, and it's [open source](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new)!

Here is what I found in its [system prompt](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new/blob/6fb59d2bc5c6e15c4e732d0f556b3a1bcbf957aa/app/lib/.server/llm/prompts.ts)

- It is clearly forked from Claude 3.5 [Artifact system prompt](https://gist.github.com/dedlim/6bf6d81f77c19e20cd40594aa09e3ecd).
- Instead of generating an entire file, Bolt turned O(N) edit cost into O(1) by [allowing GNU diff format](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new/blob/537389e178a117b0b36b5d10b6342379f18de71e/app/lib/.server/llm/prompts.ts#L66-L80).
- [File system emulation](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new/blob/537389e178a117b0b36b5d10b6342379f18de71e/app/lib/.server/llm/prompts.ts#L32) and [arbitrary npm installs](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new/blob/537389e178a117b0b36b5d10b6342379f18de71e/app/lib/.server/llm/prompts.ts#L22), all powered by [Web Container](https://webcontainers.io/)
- There is no RAG. The entire thread is submitted as context for every user message.

## Compare Bolt.new with v0

- v0 seems to use a real backend. Bolt.new runs locally inside user's browse.
- v0 is hard coded to use [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Bolt.new leaves the choice to the user.
- v0 has version management. Bolt.new does not preserve previous versions.
- v0 is single file output. Bolt.new supports multiple files.

## Compare Bolt.new with Claude 3.5 Artifact

- Claude 3.5 Artifact can only edit one file at time. Bolt.new edits multiple files.
- Claude 3.5 regenerates the entire artifact. Bolt.new can generate either full file or just the diffs.
- Bolt.new can generate more complex apps with modular components, backed by file system.

## Open source is the killer move

Bolt.new can be forked, customized, self-hosted, connected with your own LLMs. 
- StackBlitz sells more [Web Container API plans](https://stackblitz.com/pricing#webcontainer-api).
- Developers can build fully custom and privacy respecting apps.

It's a win-win.
