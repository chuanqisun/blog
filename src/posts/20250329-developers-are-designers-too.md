Have you ever considered that as a developer, you are also a UX designer? Even though you're not designing for end users, you're creating experiences for other developers who rely on the tools, libraries, and frameworks you build. By applying empathy—a core element of UX design—you can better understand and meet the needs of your developer peers, making their wear a smile as they interact with your code.

Take API design as an example. When designing an API, it's important to reflect on what assumptions you’re making about the consumer's background. What hints or guides can you offer so that users don’t have to constantly refer to the documentation? By using clear, consistent language and thoughtful metaphors, you can make it easier for developers to understand and integrate your API into their own projects.

Now consider code organization. How do you arrange your code so that other developers can intuitively locate the right files, make localized changes without jumping around the repository, and quickly determine where modifications should be made? A well-structured codebase not only reduces confusion but also improves efficiency and collaboration among team members.

Lastly, think about applying the [progressive enhancement principle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) from web development to your library design. Start with a solid base use case that works seamlessly for users who may be less experienced, and then add layers of functionality that cater to those with more skills or specific needs for customization. This approach allows every developer—from beginners to advanced users—to benefit from your work, making your library both accessible and powerful.
