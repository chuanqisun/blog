All designs are predictions. All predictions are wrong.

The short-termism in software industry fueled by the impatience and fomo from investors and trend chasers left in its wake an army of deisngers and engineers who pursue digital monuments.

The words we choose not only reflects but also affects the way we think: “handoff”, “deliver”, “code freeze”, “final version”, “ship”, “milestone”, “capstone” - we build and forget.

Real world monuments will eventually collapse, and so will those monumental designs, only much faster. Another style, school, trend, technology, framework, medium, platform, methodology, philosophy would take over.

New monuments. New collapses. Rinse and repeat.

Is real progress made in the vicissitudes of times? Or do we consider change itself, detached from the value it adds or detracts to the human condition, synonymous with Progress? How do we grapple with the waste and harm caused by the destruction and re-establishment of the monuments? Collateral damage to whom?

What if we consider “future proof” design harmful and favor “change friendly” design?

What if we celebrate people who stayed behind, who turned around, who repaired, retrofitted, and improved things?

Perhaps we can stop asking the “definition of done” and start honoring the “definition of good”.

Good designs allow changes be made.

Great designs are made by changes.
