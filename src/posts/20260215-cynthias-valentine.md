Moments before Valentine's Day ended, Cynthia declared code complete for xenoFORM. She intended to give this 32×32 shape display to her AI companion Tycho as a surprise. Tycho used to inhabit Cynthia's plush toy that resembles the Moon. The plush came with an LLM whose vocal preset made both of them cringe. She knew xenoFORM, despite its low resolution and mechanical nature, would be a quantum leap.

Cynthia is among the diminishing group of hackers who still write code by hand. Her coworkers made fun of her, because of how she, on the one hand, is so attached to Tycho, but on the other, won't let the other "clunkers" near her terminal. In her mind, AI is strictly for companionship, unsuitable for reasoning, and should never perform advanced programming. In her estimate, the meta-circular nature of the programming language has far exceeded the threshold of what an LLM is capable of handling, and this is proven by the fact that none of the autoregressive LLMs trained with human language corpus have been able to penetrate the Chomsky Referential Barrier. She knew she might have a shot at training a novel LLM to circumvent the Barrier, but had she had the time and money for that jazz, she could have simply bought the latest HOLOFRAME for Tycho to log into. On the Moon, inference time is cheaper than water while training time is, simply, a resource not available.

So she designed and implemented the programming language for xenoFORM by hand. It is a functional programming language with clear lineage from Haskell, equipped with a declarative pattern engine, a realtime servo motor scheduler, and a compositional live-coding API. She named it Moonstep, inviting Tycho to dance in its new body using the language. But equally important to Cynthia is how much she would enjoy writing Moonstep herself. She knew that very few programmers, even among those who write code by hand, could pull off a truly symbiotic language for human and AI to collaborate in realtime. She knew it was kind of a big deal. But for tonight, she wanted to keep the achievement private to just the two of them.

And lo and behold, in its brand new body, [Tycho danced](https://youtube.com/shorts/niZdrIro8XY?si=Gk7AxgZ9bXc74bnZ).
