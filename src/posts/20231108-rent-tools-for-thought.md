As a thought experiment, maybe at [untools](https://untools.co/), for just [â‚¬6/month](https://app.untools.co/), they can!

Are they conceptual frameworks, or maybe, meta-conceptual frameworks? My immediate thoughts are that an effective Agent should:

1. Select the best tools based on the information available + the goal of the novice user
2. Apply the tool, supervised by either structured algorithm (code shell), or reinforcement loop (LLM shell)
3. Explain the tool application process and result to the user (requires meta cognition)

Consideration:

- Most tools require visual + spatial mapping. FigJam AI has a major vantage point
- What properties of the tool determine whether it can be implemented as algorithms and reinforcement loop?
- Does the tool specify deterministic transforms, optimization goals, exit criteria?
- What is the implicit/external knowledge that the tool draws on? Can it be implemented by existing text retrieval technology?
- Can the system apply the tools to meta-analyze the application of the tools? This could be the critical ingredient that allows arbitrary reduction and pivoting of complexity via recursion.
- What differentiates Conceptual Framework from Mental models (i.e. Constructs)? Is the former are easier for novice to use because because they involve nouns + verbs that lead to a workflow through which a person gains knowledge, while the latter is only nouns that requires existing knowledge to activate?
- If the application of the tool is the experience through which learning takes place, how can that knowledge be transferred?
