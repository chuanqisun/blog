Let me turn the table around and say interaction design is a poor remedy for the lack of good graphic and communication design🙃️.

Please stop forcing users to “flow” through those buttons, tabs, forms, dialogs, and screens. Start by asking why there’s need for interaction at all. The best design eliminates interaction because it presents the right information in the right place at the right time to the right audience with the right voice, all without the user clicking a single button.
