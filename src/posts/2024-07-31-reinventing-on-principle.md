title: Reinventing on Principle

Today I quit the team building Microsoft's internal knowledge base for UX researchers. It was one heck of a ride for the past four years:

1. I learned to program in a [Datalog dialect](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo).
1. Picked up Python again (since my undergrad intro to CS) and wrote my first Jupyter Notebook.
1. Comfortablly coding in functional style in TypeScript, with and without [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/).
1. Intermediate VIM using VS Code extension.
1. Created mini compilers for domain specific languages (DSL): [JSON](https://github.com/chuanqisun/torex), [Azure Search OData Query](https://github.com/chuanqisun/acs-expression-builder), Figma's document object model.
1. Got very proficient in building plugins for Figma and Chromium browsers.
1. Expanded my skills from Design + Frontend into the Backend with Node.js and API developement.
1. Lots of prompt engineering and vector DB stuff. I landed as an [AI engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer) by the end.

And a few regrets and unfulfilled dreams:

1. Didn't pick up another language, either Rust or Go.
2. Didn't have a chance to build a text editor.
3. Didn't design a DSL for LLM interpreter.
4. Didn't work closer with designers, ideally [tossing hot potatoes](https://danmall.com/posts/hot-potato-process/)
5. Didn't provide technical mentorship for junior UI/UX engineers.

You win some, lose some. No regrets. As for next, I am joining Azure AI Platform UX team to help [John Maede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda) realize his vision for Computational Design. I wrote this in my farewell message:

> I'm leaving the project at this precious moment because I have to pursue another mission at AIPX. That is to bring designers and engineers together into a new discipline called Computational Design. I've tried this on my own with every project in the past and failed every single time. The circumstances have never been better than what AIPX has shown, where designers are finally exploring coding as part of their craft, thanks to AI coding assistance and John's arrival. I've learned the lesson over and over in my career: as a mentor, you can't help people who don't want help. As a developers, your best software must be adopted, not sold. As a presenter, don't answer a question that the audience are not ready to ask. Now people are asking the right question, adopting a new way of work, and needing my help. I've prepared for this moment my entire career.

> This is the easiest part of my decision because it is the most personal. I see myself as a generalist and I believe generalization is a virtue in itself. I don't believe that designers should only make mock-ups, developers should only write code, and researchers only conduct studies. I believe life is most beautiful when one can live the infinite lives of other beings, that is to share the joy in others' lives as well as to suffer their pains and experience their mundane. I see this as a higher calling than building a specific software for a specific business goal. I must live life more fully, especially after realizing life is so damn short given my poor track record on health. Besides, it's just wicked fun to play with both technology and design with a group of like-minded people. So, here I am, once more into the fray.

And that's it, becoming a generalist across design and engineering, blend art with science, from intuiting to analyzing, is my [principle to live by](https://youtu.be/PUv66718DII?si=zTTCUmUhmDcvHRrf).

Rewatching Bret's talk, his emphasis on _choice_ stood out. It is a pragmatic world view, acknowledging that if everyone does this, the world will grind to a halt when the specialists stop functioning in supporting our economy. His philosophy is not a universal virtue, but rather, among many others, just one way of life. As Samurai is a way of life for the feudal Japan, Inventing on Principle is a way of life in an industrialized capitalist society. To pursue such way of life is to follow the footsteps of the Frontiersmen and women, as rebels and romantics, to rejoice in discovery as much as to ensure the loneliness.

I'm really looking forward to set foot on this new frontiers of AI, programming, and grow my human general intelligence.
