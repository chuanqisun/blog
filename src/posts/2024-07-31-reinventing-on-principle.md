Today I left the team building Microsoft's internal knowledge base for UX researchers. It was one heck of a ride for the past four years:

1. I learned to program in a [prolog dialect](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo).
2. Wrote a few Jupyter Notebooks. It had been many years since I last touched python.
3. Comfortablly coding in functional style in TypeScript, with and without RxJS.
4. Intermediate VIM user with VS Code emuation.
5. Built few mini compilers for domain specific languages (DSL): JSON, [Azure Search OData Query](https://azuresearch.github.io/odata-syntax-diagram/#boolean_expression), Figma's document object model.
6. Got very proficient in building plugins for Figma and Chromium browsers.
7. Stretched my skills from Design + Frontend into the Backend with Node.js and API developement.
8. Lots of prompt engineer and vector DB stuff. I landed as an [AI engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer) by the end.

And a few regrets and unfulfilled dreams:

1. Didn't pick up another language, either Rust or Go.
2. Didn't have a chance to build a rich text editor.
3. Didn't design a DSL for LLM interpreter.
4. Didn't work closer with designers, ideally [tossing hot potatoes](https://danmall.com/posts/hot-potato-process/)
5. Didn't provide technical mentorship for junior UI/UX engineers.

You win some, lose some, right? As for next, I am joining Azure AI Platform UX team led by [John Maede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda). Here what I wrote to my team:

> I'm leaving the project at this precious moment because I have to pursue another mission at AIPX. That is to bring designers and engineers together into a new discipline called Computational Design. I've tried this on my own with every project in the past and failed every single time. The circumstances have never been better than what AIPX has shown, where designers are finally exploring coding as part of their craft, thanks to AI coding assistance and John's arrival. I've learned the lesson over and over in my career: as a mentor, you can't help people who don't want help. As a developers, your best software must be adopted, not sold. As a presenter, don't answer a question that the audience are not ready to ask. Now people are asking the right question, adopting a new way of work, and needing my help. I've prepared for this moment my entire career.

> This is the easiest part of my decision because it is the most personal. I see myself as a generalist and I believe generalization is a virtue in itself. I don't believe that designers should only make mock-ups, developers should only write code, and researchers only conduct studies. I believe life is most beautiful when one can live the infinite lives of other beings, that is to share the joy in others' lives as well as to suffer their pains and experience their mundane. I see this as a higher calling than building a specific software for a specific business goal. I must live life more fully, especially after realizing life is so damn short given my poor track record on health. Besides, it's just wicked fun to play with both technology and design with a group of like-minded people. So, here I am, once more into the fray.

And that's it, the principle to live by according to [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s [Inventing on Principle](https://youtu.be/PUv66718DII?si=zTTCUmUhmDcvHRrf). Rewatching that talk, a few new things stood out:

Bret emphasized on _choice_. Those who follow their principles must voluntarily discover, refine, and pursue a principle. I believe what he meant was that you can't just pick and someone else's principle without personally connecting to the motivation behind it and that connection shall be developed through the lived experience.

Bret was also displayed a practical world view on the uncommon nature of people who follows his philosophy. He mentioned that the majority of the world is not operating on the principle layers, but rather, specialize in a craft. There is nothing wrong with, again, their _choice_.
